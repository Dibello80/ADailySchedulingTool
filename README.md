# My project

My project is called "A Daily Scheduling Tool"


## Description

This app is a simple daily planner that helps to keep your day organized! 

The user can store plans from 9:00am to 5:00pm. Stardard Office hours.

At the top of this app you will have displayed the current time and based on this information the color of each row will be different.

The present time row is going to be always red while for the past hours rows the background color will be grey. The future hours rows are going to have a green color.

The app allows the user to store plans simply clicking on the save button (blue blocks with the floppy disk icon) so the data are stored in the localstorage and
won't be lost one if the page is refreshed.
